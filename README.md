# julia-exercises
A collection of exercises for my learning of the Julia programming language.

Exercism is a platform for programming exercises of many programming languages. The exercises in this repo come from exercism's Julia track. For a full list of exercises, visit https://exercism.io/my/tracks/julia. For my solutions, view the .jl files in each directory under exercism, or visit my exercism profile at https://exercism.io/profiles/ZackAshM.
