    "# Word Count\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each _word_ in that phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise you can expect that a _word_ will always be one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A _number_ composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie \"0\" or \"1234\") OR\n",
    "2. A _simple word_ composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie \"a\" or \"they\") OR\n",
    "3. A _contraction_ of two _simple words_ joined by a single apostrophe (ie \"it's\" or \"they're\")\n",
    "\n",
    "When counting words you can assume the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The count is _case insensitive_ (ie \"You\", \"you\", and \"YOU\" are 3 uses of the same word)\n",
    "2. The count is _unordered_; the tests will ignore how words and counts are ordered\n",
    "3. Other than the apostrophe in a _contraction_ all forms of _punctuation_ are ignored\n",
    "4. The words can be separated by _any_ form of whitespace (ie \"\\t\", \"\\n\", \" \")\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the phrase `\"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!\", cried the Special Agent.\\nSo I fled.` the count would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "that's: 1\n",
    "the: 2\n",
    "password: 2\n",
    "123: 1\n",
    "cried: 1\n",
    "special: 1\n",
    "agent: 1\n",
